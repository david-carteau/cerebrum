## The Cerebrum library

![Logo](/cerebrum/logo.png)

The Cerebrum library can be used to train and use "[NNUE](https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE)-like" neural networks for chess engines.

It has been first designed and created for the [Orion UCI chess engine](https://orionchess.pagesperso-orange.fr/).

Helpful information on usage will be found in the source files.
