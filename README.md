## The Cerebrum library and engine

![Logo](/v1.0/logo.png)

The **Cerebrum library** can be used to train and utilize "[NNUE](https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE)-like" neural networks for chess engines. It was initially designed and created for the [Orion UCI chess engine](https://www.orionchess.com/).

<br/>

## Changes in 1.0

- **Training now relies on game results** (from which a win ratio is deduced for each position during a game) and **material only** !
- **Data preparation** scripts are provided to automate the preparation of training data (using one or several pgn files)
- **Network quantization** is performed at the end of each training epoch, allowing the choice between better accuracy or increased inference speed
- A very basic UCI chess engine is provided in two versions (standard or quantized) to demonstrate how to load and use the network trained
- Inference C code is now also available in two versions (standard or quantized)

<br/>

## Content and prerequisites

The library consists of three main parts:

1. **Training code** (Python script)
2. **Inference code** (C files)
3. A **basic UCI chess engine** for demonstration purposes (Python script)

<br/>

To use the library, you will need:

- A **Python** runtime: https://www.python.org/
- Some Python librairies: `pip install torch numpy scipy tqdm chess`

<br/>

Note that, **by default, training is forced to use the CPU**. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can:

- Install the appropriate version of the torch library (see links below) to improve training speed
- Set `FORCE_CPU_DEVICE` to `False` in the script `train.py` (line 53) to enable GPU usage

<br/>

## Usage

### Input

You can choose to provide:

- Either one or several pgn files containing full games
- Or an handcrafted file containing position (fenstring), side to move, popcount, number of occurences of this position, win ratio:

```
2r3k1/1q3p1p/6p1/3p4/1r3N2/2n5/2PQ1PPP/R2R2K1 w 18 1 1.0<p>
1n1r1rk1/1pp3p1/p2bppp1/1q6/1P1P1P1P/P3PBP1/1Q3NK1/2R2R2 w 26 1 1.0<p>
r7/pp2bNpr/2n3Rp/4pk1P/2n5/2N1B3/PP3P2/2KR4 w 21 1 0.5<p>
rn2qr2/6b1/2pkBp1p/p1N4P/1p1P4/PQ3P2/1P6/2R1K2R b 22 1 0.5<p>
6k1/3n1pp1/pb6/3Pp2p/4N3/4P1P1/2r2PKP/1R2B3 w 18 1 0.5<p>
3k1n2/4q3/4pp2/1Np1p1p1/2P1P3/3P2P1/1PK2P2/7Q w 17 1 1.0<p>
r5k1/pb3rb1/3Rn1p1/Rp2p2p/4PP1P/2P1BNP1/4NK2/8 b 22 1 0.5<p>
8/3k4/7R/8/5PK1/8/r7/8 w 5 1 0.5<p>
5rk1/5pbp/1qN1b1p1/1PQnP3/r3B3/3p1N2/p2P1PPP/2R2RK1 w 25 1 0.5<p>
2b1k3/2p5/1pP5/4rp2/2B1pNpP/1P6/PKP5/3R4 w 17 1 1.0<p>
```

<br/>

The second option is useful when you already have a good idea of the win ratio associated to some positions. In this case, the file must be called `positions-shuffled.txt`, and be placed in the folder `./1. training/2. training/positions/`.

<br/>

### Output

Trained networks will be located in the folder `./1. training/2. training/networks/`. One network will be saved at the end of each training epoch. By default:

- `epoch-5.txt` will be the last standard network (i.e. full precision: weights and biases are stored as `float`)
- `epoch-5-q.txt` will be the last quantized network (i.e. less precision, but high inference speed: weights and biases are stored as `int8`)

<br/>

## How to replicate Orion 1.0's neural network

If you want to obtain the exact same neural network used in Orion 1.0, additional steps are required (here, for Windows):

- Download the [pgn-extract](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/) tool and put the `pgn-extract.exe` file in the folder `./1. training/1. data preparation`
- Download the [3, 4, 5 pieces](http://tablebase.sesse.net/syzygy/3-4-5/) endgame **Syzygy tablebases** and put them in the folder `./1. training/1. data preparation/syzygy/3-4-5/`
- Download the [6 pieces](http://tablebase.sesse.net/syzygy/6-WDL/) endgame Syzygy tablebases and put them in the folder `./1. training/1. data preparation/syzygy/6-pieces/`
- Download [CCRL 40/4 archive](https://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/402.archive/games.html) + [CCRL BLITZ](https://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/games.html) + [CCRL 40/15](https://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/games.html) games, unzip the 3 files to the folder `./1. training/1. data preparation/pgn/`

<br/>

You will also need to install these specific versions of Python librairies:

- `torch==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
- or, if you have an **NVIDIA GPU** `torch==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
- `numpy==1.26.3`
- `scipy==1.11.4`
- `tqdm==4.66.1`
- `chess==1.10.0`

<br/>

Important: to obtain the exact same neural network, let the `FORCE_CPU_DEVICE` variable set to `True` in the script `train.py` (line 53).

Feel free to adapt the library to meet your specific needs! ðŸŒŸ
